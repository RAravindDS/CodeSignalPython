If there are no such elements, return -1.\n\nExample\n\nFor `a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]`, the output should be solution(a) = 3.\n\nThere are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.\n\nFor `a = [2, 2]`, the output should be solution(a) = 2;\n\nFor `a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1],` the output should be solution(a) = -1.\n\n\n## answer \n\n```python\ndef solution(a):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in a:\n        if i in seen:\n            return i\n        seen.add(i)\n    return -1\n```\n\n\n\n**Give a star✨**\n",
